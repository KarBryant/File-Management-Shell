# FileShell 🗂️

A custom interactive shell for managing and organizing files from the command line — safely, efficiently, and intuitively.

## 🚀 Overview

**FileShell** is a Python-based command-line shell designed specifically for working with files and directories. Unlike traditional shells, it focuses on simplifying common file operations such as:

- Moving, copying, renaming, and sorting files
- Navigating directories with persistent context
- Undoing recent actions
- Bookmarking frequently used paths
- Running basic or external shell commands without leaving the session

It aims to bridge the gap between a full operating system shell and GUI file managers — offering power, safety, and usability for developers, power users, and CLI beginners.
